# PaiGow

Pai Gow is a minimal Android application featuring visual gameplay without core game logic. It is a utility to help learn House Way rules for correctly setting the Pai Gow hand. The app uses Compound Drawables to display the playing cards, dataBinding to manage the UI elements, and a unified onClick method to handle click activity.

This example is now available in both Java and Kotlin. Edit the Android Manifest and layout file to switch between versions.
